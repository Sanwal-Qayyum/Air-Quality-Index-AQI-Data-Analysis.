# Air-Quality-Index-AQI-Data-Analysis.
Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis Using RapidMiner

This project analyzes Air Quality Index (AQI) data using RapidMiner to identify cities with poor air quality and visualize pollution trends. The goal is to help understand how pollution changes over time and what factors may be contributing to high AQI levels.

Contents of This Repository

This repository includes the following files:

Dataset_AQI24-4.rmp
The main RapidMiner process file used to perform data cleaning, AQI analysis, and visualizations.

Dataset_AQI24-4
The dataset used in the project. It must be placed in the same folder as the .rmp file for the process to run correctly.

What the Project Does

The RapidMiner workflow performs:

Loading and preparing AQI data

Identifying cities with high pollution levels

Visualizing AQI trends over time

Highlighting potential causes of high pollution, such as traffic, industry, and population growth (based on data patterns)

How to Use This Project

Download the repository or clone it.

Keep the .rmp file and the dataset in the same folder.

Open RapidMiner Studio.

Go to File → Open Process and select Dataset_AQI24-4.rmp.

Run the process to see results and visualizations.

Purpose of the Project

This project was created as a data analysis exercise to study environmental pollution using AQI data. It demonstrates basic RapidMiner operations, including:

Data loading

Data preprocessing

Plotting trends and statistics

Simple interpretation of pollution factors
